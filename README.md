# The Pit Stop

The Pit Stop is a resource sharing platform where you can actively inform, advocate and participate in discussions about things that you feel strongly about, share ideas and solve queries to learn and grow together.

Users can create and search communities, modify the ones they own, add post and comments, votes posts and comments.

The back end was implemented with Postgres and typeORM, and the front end with NextJS, Context API, SWR library, Tailwind CSS  and TypeScript.
